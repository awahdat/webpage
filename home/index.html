	<p>My research is in the area of applied microeconomics. 
	Through my research, I aim to understand behaviors and resiliency of households and food systems, to expand the boundary of human knowledge and help identify
	policy solutions.
        I study consumer behavior, household financial decisions, and attitudes in the event of natural disasters or economic shocks. 
        I also study the vulnerability and exposure of food supply chains, and try to understand their resiliency against disasters and market shocks.
	</p>

        <p>Since my work requires advanced data methods and data analysis tools, I use methods and tools from computational science.
        I have worked with a range of datasets: cross-sectional, panel, national surveys, market surveys, 
	and randomized control trials both in the field and lab.
        I have experience with various data analysis software: Stata, R, Python, Matlab, GAMS, ArcGIS.</p>

        <p>I have also worked with organizations in the non-profit and academic sectors. Most of my work involved academic research
	or project management. I have worked with the World Bank, Harvard Business School, MIT Sloan School of Management, 
	German International Cooperation (in Afghanistan), and CSIS.
        In my free time, I enjoy cooking, brewing coffee, reading, improving my coding skills, and thinking of solutions for disadvantaged units in a society. </p>
