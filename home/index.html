	<p>My research is in the area of applied microeconomics.
		Through my research, I aim to understand the behaviors and resiliency of   
		households and food systems. 
		I study consumer behavior, attitudes, and household financial decisions under natural disasters, economic shocks, or policy changes. 
		I also study the vulnerability and exposure of food supply chains and try to understand their 
		resiliency against adverse events. In my research, I pay special attention to socially and economically disadvantaged groups.
		From a policy perspective, my research aim is to inform government efforts regarding household food security, agribusiness supply chains,  
		and disaster resilience and recovery. I use causal inference methods, experiments, online surveys, and
		machine learning methods, to identify economic parameters of interest. </p>

        <p>Since my work requires advanced data methods and data analysis tools, I use methods from computational science, i.e., data science, machine learning,
		and algorithms. 
		I have worked with a range of datasets: cross-sectional, panel, national surveys, market surveys, and randomized control 
		trials both in the field and lab. I have experience with various data analysis software: Stata, R, Python, Matlab, GAMS, ArcGIS.</p>

        <p>I have also worked with organizations in the non-profit and academic sectors. Most of my work involved academic 
		research or project management. I have worked with the World Bank, Harvard Business School, MIT Sloan School of Management, 
		German International Cooperation (in Afghanistan), and CSIS. In my free time, I enjoy cooking, brewing coffee, reading, 
		improving my coding skills, and thinking of solutions for disadvantaged units in a society.</p>
