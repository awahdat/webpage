According to the latest [Household Pulse Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey/data.html) conducted between January 4-16, 2023, natural disasters have displaced between **3 to 3.8 million** American adults from their homes in 2022. The disasters include hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and fires. This is probably the first time that we have a credible, national-level estimate of the impact of natural disasters on Americans, and the results are alarming.

The survey found that **38%** of displaced adults from households could not return to their homes for at least a month, indicating the severity of the impact. These findings highlight the need for disaster preparedness and management programs across the country.

Among the states that were hit the hardest, Louisiana and Florida had the highest percentage of displaced adults. In Louisiana, 12.8% of adults in households were displaced, which translates to 368,529 people. In Florida, 6.1% of adults in households were displaced, which is equivalent to 888,985 people. 

It is interesting to note that both Louisiana and Florida are coastal states, where significant populations and property are located along the coastal lines. With the frequency and intensity of hurricanes on the rise in the [North Atlantic region](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature03906), it is imperative that coastal states invest in disaster preparedness programs.

According to the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/), **the United States witnessed 18 weather and climate disaster events in 2022**, each causing damages of at least $1 billion. This is more than double the annual average of 7.9 events between 1980 and 2022 (CPI-adjusted). The Household Pulse Survey results highlight the significant impact of natural disasters on Americans and the need for disaster preparedness programs. With the frequency and intensity of natural disasters increasing, it is crucial for individuals, communities, and governments to take proactive measures to protect lives and property.
