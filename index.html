	<p>My research is in the area of applied microeconomics. I focus on food and agricultural economics, behavioral and experimental 
	economics, and household finance topics. 
        I study consumer behavior, household financial decisions, and attitudes in the event of economic shocks or natural disasters. 
        I also study the vulnerability of food and agribusinesses, i.e., resiliency against disasters and market shocks,
	investment and risk-taking capacity after natural disasters.</p>

        <p>Since my work requires advanced data methods and data analysis tools, I specialized in computational science during my doctoral program.
        Since 2010, I have worked with a range of datasets: cross-sectional, panel, national surveys, market surveys, and randomized control trials both in the field and lab.
        I have worked with various data analysis software: Stata, R, Python, Matlab, GAMS, ArcGIS.</p>

        <p>Before my Ph.D., I worked with organizations in the non-profit and academic sectors. Most of my work involved academic research
	or project management. I really enjoyed my time at the World Bank, Harvard Business School, MIT Sloan School of Management, German International Cooperation, and CSIS.
        In my free time (if available!) I enjoy cooking, reading, improving my coding skills, and thinking of solutions for disadvantaged units in a society. </p>
