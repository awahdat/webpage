    Its main objective was that students learn how to do economics, i.e., to analyze economic events by applying economic tools. 
    The learning objective was that after taking the class students should be able to analyze personal and global economic issues,
    by applying (1) knowledge of economic measurement, (2) economic models, and (3) the history of U.S. economic policy.
  The course was designed as an asynchronous online/distance course, meaning students could
