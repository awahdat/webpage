	<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We study the association of disaster displacement with household food insufficiency in the United States.
		Using the nationally representative Household Pulse Survey, we find that disaster displacement 
		is associated with a higher incidence of food insufficiency of 8.9 percentage points (pp), with
		variations depending on the duration of displacement. Brief displacement from tornadoes is associated 
		with a higher incidence of food insufficiency of 15.8 pp. Extended displacement from floods is associated with 
		a higher incidence of food insufficiency of 14.7 pp, followed by hurricanes, tornadoes, and fires. We 
		find that the receipt of free food among displaced households is strongly associated with food insufficiency. 
		Although we control for observed confounders, our estimated associations might be biased upwards due to unobserved 
		variables. Despite that, our study offers insights for policymakers and organizations involved in disaster recovery, 
		emphasizing the need to understand and address food insufficiency after natural disasters.</p>

		Extreme Weather Events, Food Shopping Behavior, and Card Spending. (forthcoming in  the Journal of Agricultural and Applied Economics Association)</button>
	<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Climate change is expected to increase the frequency and severity of hurricanes.  
		While aggregate ex-post costs of hurricanes are frequently estimated, less is known about the public 
		responses to such disasters. Without causal evidence at granular levels, multi-stakeholder response 
		to extreme weather is challenging, particularly in terms of food supply chains. We examine the impact of 
		Hurricane Ian on food retail sales and consumer spending behavior in Florida. We show how shopping 
		patterns evolved before and during the hurricane across ten food and beverage categories, with 
		significant stockpiling for commercially prepared foods, beverages, and meats/eggs/nuts categories. 
		Using debit card data, we show that card spending peaked at general retail stores five days before the hurricane, 
		and then shifted to convenience and grocery stores. Our findings highlight the need for better stockpiling 
		guidelines and supply chain solutions during extreme weather events, which are expected to increase due to climate change.</p>

		Consumer Grocery Stockpiling Behavior. (forthcoming in the Canadian Journal of Agricultural Economics)</button>
		
	<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Grocery stockpiling is a common behavioral response to the emergence of disasters or 
		heightened uncertainty. Nonetheless, the phenomenon, and methods for mitigating it, are not well understood. 
		Using a model of household shopping and inventory management, we conceptualize stockpiling as a result of an 
		increase in the fixed cost of making grocery shopping trips, or the opportunity cost of time associated with 
		shopping. In a laboratory experiment, we find that stockpiling increases (decreases) by 78%, 41% (22%) with 
		an increase in fixed costs, price reductions (imposition of purchase limits), respectively. We also find that 
		stockpiling leads to fewer (more) grocery trips by 33%, 22% (36%) under the same three conditions, 
		respectively. Our experiment and subsequent cluster analysis suggest that loss aversion actually suppresses 
		stockpiling.  Our experiment shows that imposing purchase limits, a common retail response to stock-outs, 
		can trigger stockpiling during shopping trips without purchase limits. Although we do not claim external validity, 
		our study suggests that store managers and policymakers should be careful about solutions during a stockpiling 
		event, such that they do not exacerbate stockpiling, which may disproportionately affect vulnerable groups and disrupt supply chains.</p>

	<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Consumer food purchasing and willingness to adopt a sustainable healthy diet (SHD) is a key factor affecting 
		the sustainability of the entire food system. Studies have developed scales to measure consumer preferences for particular 
		consumption patterns, while others have sought to empirically define the multiple dimensions of a sustainable food system 
		(environmental, social, economic, etc.). This paper builds on these literatures by tracking consumers’ SHD behaviors using a 
		large-scale, longitudinal survey of adults in the United States and mapping them onto multiple systems-level indicators. 
		We wanted to know whether consumers interact with the sustainability of their food along the same principles developed by experts.
		Our study defines 18 food purchasing behaviors that support the sustainability goals of leading scientific institutions, 
		uses factor analysis to identify the unobserved drivers behind these behaviors, and creates SHD scores to investigate their 
		correlations with other consumer characteristics and behaviors. Factor analysis results show consumer food purchasing is 
		motivated by three underlying sustainability dimensions—Economic Security, Socio-Environment, and Nutrition—which are fewer 
		constructs than often defined by academic researchers. SHD scores reveal higher adoption of behaviors that fall under 
		Economic Security relative to the other two dimensions. All three sustainability constructs are impacted by socio-economic 
		and demographic characteristics.</p>

	The Achilles Heel of the U.S. Food Industries: Exposure to Labor and Upstream Industries in the Supply Chain,
	<em>American Journal of Agricultural Economics</em>, 1-20.</button>
        
	<p>[<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ajae.12331" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Published Online Article</a>]</p> 

	<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>The modern-day food industries are part of a complex agri-food supply chain, where 
		food production has become efficient, yet potentially vulnerable to supply chain risks. The COVID-19 pandemic is 
		a testament to that end. This article measures and identifies the U.S. food manufacturing industries' vulnerability to 
		upstream industries and labor occupations by (i) calculating a food industry's diversification of intermediate input 
		purchases across upstream industries, (ii) quantifying the relative exposure of food manufacturing in a given industry 
		and location to upstream input suppliers and labor occupations, and (iii) estimating each food industry's gross 
		output elasticity of inputs. This article also explores geographic heterogeneity in food industries' vulnerability. 
		Among our results, we find evidence that the animal processing industry's output is relatively vulnerable to 
		production labor, consistent with the observed disruptions to the meatpacking sector during COVID-19, 
		which were largely caused by labor issues. Our results may help academics and practitioners to understand 
		food industries' vulnerabilities to upstream industries and labor occupations.</p>

Economic Impact Payments and Household Food Insufficiency during COVID-19: The Case of Late Recipients, 
		 <em>Economics of Disasters and Climate Change</em>.</button>
        
	<p>[<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s41885-022-00115-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Published Article</a>]</p> 

	<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>During the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. government distributed Economic Impact Payments (EIPs) 
		to ease the economic hardships of American households. Using the Household Pulse Survey, we study the association of 
		first-round EIPs with household-level food insufficiency in a sample of late recipients of EIPs. Studying the late 
		recipients is important for two reasons, first, about 12 million eligible individuals did not automatically receive 
		EIPs, and second, the late receipt of EIPs and the low-income status of late recipients allow us to tease out the 
		relationship between EIPs and food insufficiency. We find that EIPs were associated with a 9.2 percentage points 
		decrease in the likelihood of food insufficiency. However, households kept relying on free food acquisition to fight 
		food hardship. Our results suggest that government efforts to provide more timely stimulus payments could be very 
		impactful and significantly impact household food insufficiency.</p>

          Farm Producers' Household Consumption and Individual Risk Behavior after Natural Disasters, <em>Agricultural and Resource Economics Review</em>,

	<p> [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/age.2021.2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Published Article</a>]

	</p>
	
	<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Understanding how farm household consumption responds to adverse income shocks can provide insight 
		into household well-being and appropriate agricultural policy. Using a split-sample survey of Indiana specialty producers, 
		where we randomly assign respondents to treatments that vary the size of a hypothetical income shock, we estimate the relationship
		between income loss and household consumption. Given that postdisaster producers' risk preferences are important for business decisions, 
		we elicit producers' risk preferences. We find that food and miscellaneous expenses are the most sensitive to income losses. 
		We also find evidence for decreasing absolute risk aversion among producers after the income loss shock.</p>

	     forthcoming in <em>Agricultural Finance Review</em>.</button>

	<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> 
		<br><strong>Purpose:</strong> The study investigates whether there is an association between climate types and farm risk attitudes of principal operators. 
		<br><strong>Methodology:</strong> The study exploits temperature variation in the diverse climate types across the United States and defines
		hot- and cold-climate states. Ordered logit and generalized ordered logit models are used to model principal operators’ farm risk attitudes,
		which are measured on a Likert scale. The study uses two datasets. The first dataset is a 2017 survey of U.S. large commercial producers. 
		The second dataset provides a Köppen-Geiger climate classification of the United States at a spatial resolution of 5 arcmin for a 25-year period 
		(1986-2010).
		<br><strong>Findings:</strong> The study finds that principal operators in hot-climate states are 4%-5% more likely to have a higher willingness to take
		farm risk compared to principal operators in cold-climate states. 
		<br><strong>Research Implications:</strong> It is likely that farm risk mitigation decisions differ between hot- and cold-climate states.
		For instance, we show that corn acres’ enrollment in federal crop insurance and computers’ usage for farm business are pursued more
		intensely in cold-climate states than in hot-climate states. A differentiation of farm risk attitude by hot- and cold-climate states may 
		help agribusiness,  the government, and economists in their farm product offerings, farm risk management programs, and agricultural
		finance models, respectively. 
		<br><strong>Originality:</strong> Based on Köppen-Geiger climate classification,  the study introduces hot- and cold-climate concepts to understand the relationship 
		between climate types and principal operators’ farm risk attitudes.</p>

		published by the <em>Princeton School of Public and International Affairs</em>.</button>
	<p>[<a href="https://shorturl.at/cLgmy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Published Working Paper</a>]</p>
		
	<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this research, we use data from the 2022 Whole of Afghanistan Assessment to
		identify key sociodemographic factors related to food insecurity and hunger in Afghanistan.
		Our findings underscore the multifaceted nature of food insecurity, emphasizing the importance
		of addressing not only socioeconomic variables but also infrastructure and housing conditions.
		These identified factors provide crucial information for policymakers and practitioners who want
		to develop targeted interventions to combat food insecurity and hunger in Afghanistan. Significant
		factors associated with food insecurity and hunger include female-headed households, household size,
		presence of children under 12, debt, low income, rural residency, and shelter damage. For instance,
		female-headed households and those with shelter damage exhibit increased vulnerability. In addition,
		economic stability plays a vital role, as households with debt or low recent income are more susceptible
		to food insecurity and hunger. Although rural households demonstrate a lower prevalence, access to basic
		amenities and infrastructure is strongly associated with food security outcomes. Addressing these factors
		is essential to effectively mitigate food insecurity and hunger in Afghanistan.</p>

		of the U.S. Meatpacking Industry. (journal submitted)</button>
		
	<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The U.S. meatpacking industry is part of a complex meat supply chain. Understanding
		its vulnerability requires a consideration of the industry's internal and external factors that
		are spatially heterogeneous. We introduce the county-level Meatpacking Risk Index score,
		which identifies the riskiness or spatial vulnerability of the U.S. meatpacking industry.
		Our index is constructed from three county-level indices: (i) potential meatpacking output loss from
		shock events, (ii) social vulnerability, and (iii) community resilience. A total of 376 (1,445)
		counties classify as high-risk (low-risk) counties for meatpacking production. Our validation
		exercise shows that the index can correctly distinguish between high- and low-risk counties,
		in terms of meatpacking product losses, when exposed to exogenous shocks. Investor and
		current meat packers may use the index to locate in places with lower risks and disruptions.
		State and federal governments may use the index to reduce county-level vulnerabilities, and attract investments. </p>

	<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We exploit spatial and temporal variation in natural disasters in the United States via 
		a generalized differences-in-differences approach to identify the impact of natural disasters on households’ food-at-home (FAH)
		spending and quality from 2005 to 2016. Using the Storm Events Database and the Nielsen Consumer Panel Data, 
		we find that floods (hurricanes) have a persistent (immediate) effect on FAH spending. On average, 
		highly damaging floods (hurricanes) decrease 15-day FAH spending by about $1-$2 ($7) in 90 days (30 days) after the events.
		The FAH spending effect of natural disasters works through both income and price channels. 
		We also find that the natural disasters have an inconsequential or no impact on FAH quality. 
		Our results are robust to the inclusion of county-specific linear trends. 
		Our findings could be of interest to post-disaster relief organizations and their programs.</p>

      <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this study, I investigate  household consumption response to realized income shocks when 
       households have reference-dependent preferences for consumption expenditures. 
I consider households’ reference level of consumption expenditures in the current period to be equal to last period's expenditures. 
Using longitudinal data on Australian households and exploiting variation in income shocks at the household level, 
	I estimate loss aversion in consumption expenditures. I find that losses in consumption expenditures loom about 1.4 times larger than equal value gains. 
	The magnitude and statistical significance of the loss aversion estimate is robust to an alternative reference point that is based on 
	the average expenditures of last two periods. I also show that retirement-age households (working-age households) have a symmetric (asymmetric) 
	consumption response to realized income shocks.</p>
