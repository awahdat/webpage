	<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Understanding how farm household consumption responds to adverse income shocks can provide insight 
		into household well-being and appropriate agricultural policy. Using a split-sample survey of Indiana specialty producers, 
		where we randomly assign respondents to treatments that vary the size of a hypothetical income shock, we estimate the relationship
		between income loss and household consumption. Given that postdisaster producers' risk preferences are important for business decisions, 
		we elicit producers' risk preferences. We find that food and miscellaneous expenses are the most sensitive to income losses. 
		We also find evidence for decreasing absolute risk aversion among producers after the income loss shock.</p>

	<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> 
		<br><strong>Purpose:</strong> The study investigates whether there is an association between climate types and farm risk attitudes of principal operators. 
		<br><strong>Methodology:</strong> The study exploits temperature variation in the diverse climate types across the United States and defines
		hot- and cold-climate states. Ordered logit and generalized ordered logit models are used to model principal operators’ farm risk attitudes,
		which are measured on a Likert scale. The study uses two datasets. The first dataset is a 2017 survey of U.S. large commercial producers. 
		The second dataset provides a Köppen-Geiger climate classification of the United States at a spatial resolution of 5 arcmin for a 25-year period 
		(1986-2010).
		<br><strong>Findings:</strong> The study finds that principal operators in hot-climate states are 4%-5% more likely to have a higher willingness to take
		farm risk compared to principal operators in cold-climate states. 
		<br><strong>Research Implications:</strong> It is likely that farm risk mitigation decisions differ between hot- and cold-climate states.
		For instance, we show that corn acres’ enrollment in federal crop insurance and computers’ usage for farm business are pursued more
		intensely in cold-climate states than in hot-climate states. A differentiation of farm risk attitude by hot- and cold-climate states may 
		help agribusiness,  the government, and economists in their farm product offerings, farm risk management programs, and agricultural
		finance models, respectively. 
		<br><strong>Originality:</strong> Based on Köppen-Geiger climate classification,  the study introduces hot- and cold-climate concepts to understand the relationship 
		between climate types and principal operators’ farm risk attitudes.</p>

The Achilles Heel of the U.S. Food Industries: Exposure to Labor and Upstream Industries in the Supply Chain.</button>
        
	<p>[<a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=3957604" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SSRN Version</a>]</p> 

	<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>The modern day food industries are part of a complex agri-food supply chain, 
		where food production has become efficient, yet potentially vulnerable to supply chain risks. 
		The COVID-19 pandemic is a testament to that end. This article measures and identifies the U.S. food 
		manufacturing industries' vulnerability to upstream industries and labor occupations by (i) calculating 
		a food industry's diversification of intermediate input purchases across upstream industries, (ii) quantifying 
		the relative exposure of food manufacturing in a given industry and location to upstream input suppliers and 
		labor occupations, and (iii) estimating each food industry's gross output elasticity of inputs. 
		Among our results, we find the evidence that the animal processing industry's output is relatively 
		vulnerable to production labor which is consistent with the observed disruptions to the meat packing 
		sector during COVID19, which were largely caused by labor issues. Our results may help academics and 
		practitioners to understand food industries' vulnerabilities to upstream industries and labor occupations.</p>

	<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>We exploit spatial and temporal variation in natural disasters in the United States via 
		a generalized differences-in-differences approach to identify the impact of natural disasters on households’ food-at-home (FAH)
		spending and quality from 2005 to 2016. Using the Storm Events Database and the Nielsen Consumer Panel Data, 
		we find that floods (hurricanes) have a persistent (immediate) effect on FAH spending. On average, 
		highly damaging floods (hurricanes) decrease 15-day FAH spending by about $1-$2 ($7) in 90 days (30 days) after the events.
		The FAH spending effect of natural disasters works through both income and price channels. 
		We also find that the natural disasters have an inconsequential or no impact on FAH quality. 
		Our results are robust to the inclusion of county-specific linear trends. 
		Our findings could be of interest to post-disaster relief organizations and their programs.</p>

      <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this study, I investigate  household consumption response to realized income shocks when 
       households have reference-dependent preferences for consumption expenditures. 
I consider households’ reference level of consumption expenditures in the current period to be equal to last period's expenditures. 
Using longitudinal data on Australian households and exploiting variation in income shocks at the household level, 
	I estimate loss aversion in consumption expenditures. I find that losses in consumption expenditures loom about 1.4 times larger than equal value gains. 
	The magnitude and statistical significance of the loss aversion estimate is robust to an alternative reference point that is based on 
	the average expenditures of last two periods. I also show that retirement-age households (working-age households) have a symmetric (asymmetric) 
	consumption response to realized income shocks.</p>
