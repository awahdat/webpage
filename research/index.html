	<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Understanding how farm household consumption responds to adverse income shocks can
	provide insight into household well-being and appropriate agricultural policy. Using a split-sample
	survey of Indiana specialty producers, where we randomly assign respondents to
	treatments that vary the size of a hypothetical income shock, we estimate the relationship
	between income loss and household consumption. Given that post-disaster producers’ risk
	preferences are important for business decisions, we elicit producers’ risk preferences. We
	find that food and miscellaneous expenses are the most sensitive to income losses. We also
	find evidence for decreasing absolute risk aversion among producers after the income loss
	shock.</p>

	<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>We exploit spatial and temporal variation in natural disasters in the United States via 
		a generalized differences-in-differences approach to identify the impact of natural disasters on households’ food-at-home (FAH)
		spending and quality from 2005 to 2016. Using the Storm Events Database and the Nielsen Consumer Panel Data, 
		we find that floods (hurricanes) have a persistent (immediate) effect on FAH spending. On average, 
		highly damaging floods (hurricanes) decrease 15-day FAH spending by about $1-$2 ($7) in 90 days (30 days) after the events.
		The FAH spending effect of natural disasters works through both income and price channels. 
		We also find that the natural disasters have an inconsequential or no impact on FAH quality. 
		Our results are robust to the inclusion of county-specific linear trends. 
		Our findings could be of interest to post-disaster relief organizations and their programs.</p>

     <p><strong>Wahdat, Ahmad Z.</strong>, and Michael A. Gunderson. 2020. "U.S. Agricultural CEOs' Farm-Operation Risk Attitudes between Hot and Cold Temperature Climates"
	     Working Paper, Agricultural Economics, Purdue University.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Is there a relationship between different types of climate and agricultural
	CEOs' farm risk attitudes? We exploit temperature variation in the diverse
	climate types across the United States and define hot- and cold-climate states.
	Using a survey of commercial producers, we find that agricultural CEOs in
	hot-climate states are 4%-5% more likely to have a higher willingness to take
	farm risk compared to the CEOs in cold-climate states. This result resonates
	with the literature finding that agricultural producers adopt additional,
	new farm-level methods and strategies when managing climate change
	threats, which are becoming intense and frequent in hot-climate states.</p>

     <p><strong>Wahdat, Ahmad Z.</strong> 2020. "Income Shock and Loss Aversion in Consumption Expenditures."
	     Working Paper, Agricultural Economics, Purdue University.</p>
      <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this study, I investigate  household consumption response to realized income shocks when 
       households have reference-dependent preferences for consumption expenditures. 
I consider households’ reference level of consumption expenditures in the current period to be equal to last period's expenditures. 
Using longitudinal data on Australian households and exploiting variation in income shocks at the household level, 
	I estimate loss aversion in consumption expenditures. I find that losses in consumption expenditures loom about 1.4 times larger than equal value gains. 
	The magnitude and statistical significance of the loss aversion estimate is robust to an alternative reference point that is based on 
	the average expenditures of last two periods. I also show that retirement-age households (working-age households) have a symmetric (asymmetric) 
	consumption response to realized income shocks.</p>
