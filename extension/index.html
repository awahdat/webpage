	<p><strong>Dashboard Purpose:</strong> The U.S. food and beverage industries are the connecting link between the 
		agriculture sector and the grocery retail sector. In a nutshell, the U.S. food and beverage industries buy 
		raw inputs from farmers and sell final or intermediate products to both consumers and producers. This dashboard 
		provides information on each industryâ€™s production value, revenue, costs and employment. All such information 
		is presented at the U.S. state level.</p>
