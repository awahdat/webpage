	<p><strong>Dashboard Purpose:</strong> This dashboard presents the estimated value of vulnerable production in food and beverage 
    industries due to estimated COVID-19 cases among industry workers. Users can find information on estimated vulnerable 
    production in the past 365 days and past 30 days; COVID-19 industry worker cases in the past 365 days and past 30 days; 
    total industry jobs, and total payrolled industry establishments. This dashboard can display information both at the state and county level.</p>

	     forthcoming in Agricultural Finance Review.</button>
	
	<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> 
		<br><strong>Purpose:</strong> The study investigates whether there is an association between climate types and farm risk attitudes of principal operators. 
		<br><strong>Methodology:</strong> The study exploits temperature variation in the diverse climate types across the United States and defines
		hot- and cold-climate states. Ordered logit and generalized ordered logit models are used to model principal operators’ farm risk attitudes,
		which are measured on a Likert scale. The study uses two datasets. The first dataset is a 2017 survey of U.S. large commercial producers. 
		The second dataset provides a Köppen-Geiger climate classification of the United States at a spatial resolution of 5 arcmin for a 25-year period 
		(1986-2010).
		<br><strong>Findings:</strong> The study finds that principal operators in hot-climate states are 4%-5% more likely to have a higher willingness to take
		farm risk compared to principal operators in cold-climate states. 
		<br><strong>Research Implications:</strong> It is likely that farm risk mitigation decisions differ between hot- and cold-climate states.
		For instance, we show that corn acres’ enrollment in federal crop insurance and computers’ usage for farm business are pursued more
		intensely in cold-climate states than in hot-climate states. A differentiation of farm risk attitude by hot- and cold-climate states may 
		help agribusiness,  the government, and economists in their farm product offerings, farm risk management programs, and agricultural
		finance models, respectively. 
		<br><strong>Originality:</strong> Based on Köppen-Geiger climate classification,  the study introduces hot- and cold-climate concepts to understand the relationship 
		between climate types and principal operators’ farm risk attitudes.</p>
